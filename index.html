        <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </center>
    
    <p>The advantages of the introduction of Information and Communication Technologies
(ICT) in the complex Healthcare sector have already been depicted and analyzed in the
Healthcare Informatics bibliography (Eder, 2000; Englebardt & Nelson, 2002; Harmoni,
2002; Norris, Fuller, Goldberg, & Tarczy-Hornoch, 2002; Shortliffe, Perreault, Wiederhold,
& Fagan, 2001; Stegwee & Spil, 2001). It is nevertheless paradoxical that, although several
major technological discoveries such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Nuclear Medicine and Digital Radiology, which facilitate improvement in patient care, have been
satisfactorily embraced by the medical community, this has not been the case with
Healthcare Informatics. Thus, it can be argued that issues such as Data Management,
Data Modeling, and Knowledge Management have a long way to go before reaching the
maturity level that other technologies have achieved in the medical sector.</p>
    
    <p>A variety of reasons could be proposed for this issue, though with a short analysis it
becomes rather clear that modern ICT present integration problems within the healthcare
sector because of the way the latter is organized. Healthcare is a strongly people-centered
sector in which ICT has been considered more as an intruder, as a “spy” to the healthcare
professionals’ way of doing things and as a competitor to this people-centered model.
Thus, if ICT intend to prove its advantages towards establishing an information society,
or even more a knowledge society, it has to focus on providing service-oriented
solutions. In other words, it has to focus on people and this has not been the case in most
of the circumstances. It is common knowledge that in order to install any type of
information system in healthcare, especially if it involves knowledge management, six
main groups of issues have to be dealt with (Iakovidis, 1998, 2000):</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. The organizational and cultural matters related to healthcare. This issue is rather
important, regardless of any information system, since organizational models and
culture do not endorse the continuity of care or any type of structured data
collection. Issues such as mistrust between different specialists, between the
different healthcare structures or between doctors and nurses prevent in many
cases the effective sharing of information. Health reforms are currently under way
        in many countries stressing the will to deal with this problem.</p>
    
        
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. The technological gap between healthcare professionals and information science
experts. Doctors are often reluctant to use information systems that they believe
are not designed for them. From another point of view, Healthcare Informatics have
been introduced in healthcare institutions mostly on pilot-based projects aiming</p>
    
    
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;at addressing specific issues and have proposed solutions addressing a small
number of healthcare practitioners, resulting in establishing a complex map of
information niches. This approach is the consequence of applying information
technology to procedures that where not designed for it, thus creating a panspermia of information models which are neither compatible nor interoperable, even
within a single institution’s environment. Efforts in creating interoperability
standards and protocols such as HL7 are proposing solutions to address this issue,
thus enabling data manipulation and knowledge management.</p>

    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3. The legal requirements on the confidentiality of personal and patient related data
and on data privacy. It is clear that if this issue is not addressed at a managerial and
procedural level by imposing suitable policies to meet these requirements, there is
little chance that medical data will be kept digitally in a structured manner (thus
allowing the transition from digital islands of clinical data towards a structured
electronic healthcare record). The implementation of an information system, where
the electronic healthcare record is considered to be the core of the system (patientcentered model), is the only way to drive data management towards creating new
knowledge. The complexity of the problem can be explained if one just observes
the course of implementation of both the Health Information Privacy and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the US and Directive 95/46/EC in the EU. The issues seem
to have been dealt with at the strategic level, but still a lot has to be done in the
implementation and setup of those strategies.</p>
    
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4. The industrial and market position of Healthcare Informatics. In general, the
healthcare market is seen by the industry as large in size but not highly profitable,
mainly due to the lack of standards in implementing and interoperating healthcare
informatics products. As a consequence, the industry has focused on creating
mostly small-scale products (i.e., Laboratory Information Systems, Radiology
Information Systems, Clinical Information Systems) and not on evangelizing the
production of information system that are dealing with healthcare as a whole. The
lack of end-to-end solutions is dealt with by interconnecting heterogeneous
information systems (a rather complex task with constant change management
issues) and by introducing solutions from other business sectors (i.e., ERP, SCM,
CRM) that have often been rejected by “key users” as non-compliant with their job
description. Nevertheless, the new Web technology approaches (Web services,
XML, etc.) and the new information technology strategies (i.e., service oriented
architecture) could be the drivers towards merging information technology and
healthcare services and thus enabling the establishment of knowledge management products.</p>
    
    
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5. The lack of vision and leadership of healthcare managers and health authorities,
and the lack of willingness to re-engineer healthcare processes for the benefits of
efficiency and quality of care delivery. Some countries are in the process of
introducing or implementing such Business Process Reengineering projects in
order to address healthcare delivery in a more information flow conformant way.
This is a key point in reaching knowledge management, knowledge re-use and
sharing, and finally proposing a solution for the knowledge-based society of
tomorrow. This issue should be dealt with by proposing strategies that focus on
processes and by establishing key performance indicators, balanced scorecards,</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;or other metrics that are the upper level of a structured information flow-based
model.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6. User acceptability and usability of the proposed information systems. This issue
is the one most strongly related to the problem of dealing with the people-centered
approach of the healthcare sector. This issue deals with information systems’ user
friendliness, with usability issues such as the time to reach a data entry point, the
speed of information retrieval, the quality of information retrieval, the complex
security procedures, and so on. In order to implement information systems and
knowledge management systems, education and training must be addressed with
high priority since user acceptability is strongly related to them. Service oriented
models and patient-centered information systems have a higher chance of passing
the user acceptability test. A system that is not accepted by the user is often a
system with poor data quality (or no data at all) and knowledge management,
business intelligence or data warehousing solutions are consequently inoperable
and unsuccessful.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>Taking all of the above issues into consideration, this chapter proposes to explore trends
and best practices regarding knowledge management from the viewpoint of performance
management, based upon the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) in healthcare
systems. By assessing both balanced scorecards (Kaplan/Norton) and quality assurance techniques in healthcare (Donabedian), it is possible to foresee an electronic
healthcare record centered approach which drives information flow at all levels of the
day-to-day process of delivering effective and managed care, and which finally moves
towards information assessment and knowledge discovery (both with administrative and
medical data). KPIs should be regarded as the strategic assessment tool, for both the
executives and the clinical decision-makers, that will lead healthcare delivery to excellence and to knowledge discovery and assessment.</p>

Healthcare</h2>

    <p>Today, Knowledge Management (KM) is on everyone’s mind. Healthcare organizations
are no exception and are accepting the challenge to more effectively share knowledge
both internally and externally (Strawser, 2000). The growth of KM projects (i.e., decision
support systems, data mining tools, business intelligence solutions) signals a growing
conviction that managing institutional knowledge is crucial to business success and
possibly business survival. When the hype and confusion are stripped away, it is
apparent that KM initiatives can profoundly change a healthcare enterprise for the better,
and bring numerous advantages to Healthcare Information Management (HIM) professionals. For HIM professionals, KM is worthy of special attention because it informs</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>them not only on how to do things, but also on how they might do them better. In order
for this to happen, data should be provided in specific patterns and should be based upon
a strategy that will empower a healthcare system by gaining knowledge of its processes,
its outcomes, and its structures.</p>
    
    
    <p>Despite the obvious advantages, many healthcare decision makers view the idea of a KM
initiative with scepticism, possibly because of an incomplete or incorrect understanding
of the tools needed to achieve it. Many of the tools and strategies associated with
implementing KM are not new; what is new is a cohesive approach to KM design and
implementation. Certainly there are pitfalls and limitations in using information technology for KM—trying to force fluid knowledge into rigid data structures, for example, or
focusing too much on the tools and not enough on the content. But networks and
computers, with their ability to connect people and store and retrieve virtually unlimited
amounts of information, can dramatically improve departmental efficiencies. Some
examples of knowledge management applications are listed below:
</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p><b>• Data Mining tools </b> enable decision makers to search and analyze large sets of data
by using specific querying methods and tools (Standard Query Language, Rough
Data set, On Line Analytical Processing).
</p>
    
    <p><b>• Document and Content Management systems </b>are widely used to store and archive
files of any type (text, images, video, etc.) and correlated them with keywords that
have a business meaning to the end user.</p>
    

    <p><b>• Knowledge Maps </b>are graphical or other representations of how and by whom a
specific set of information is created, distributed and assessed. Knowledge Maps
        are very important tools in Total Quality Management projects.</b>
    
    
    
    <p>•<b>Intelligent Agents </b>use a combination of profiling techniques, search tools, and
recognition algorithms to provide up to date specific information to the end user.
For example, intelligent agents could be used to forward completed test results to
the corresponding physicians of a patient.</p>
    

    
    <p><b>• Web Browsers </b>are the most commonly used tools for searching information in an
intranet or the Internet. As such, Web browsers are increasingly becoming the most
common graphical user interface, even for specific software products such as
financial accounting and patient order entry systems.</p>
    
    
    
    <p><b>• Business Intelligence tools and Data Warehouses </b>enable the decision maker to
have predefined access to specific information of interest regardless of the
physical location of the data. Such systems are ideal for performance management
and executive reporting and serve as the technological base for supporting the idea
of a digital dashboard of indicators.</p>
    
    <p><b>• Workflow applications </b> play a very important role in KM since knowledge is created
during the process-based operations that take place in a healthcare institution. A
computerised patient order entry system is a classic example of a process-based
operation in healthcare that requires the constant monitoring of the workflow
        status.</p>
